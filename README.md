# Simple-Project-Coffee-Shop


Project Idea:

The **Costa Coffee** project is a simple website consisting of **five main pages**:

- 🏠 **Home Page:** General information about the coffee shop and a menu with prices and services.
- 🔑 **Login Page:** For user sign-in.
- 📝 **Register Page:** For creating a new account.
- 📄 **Other Pages:** Display simple content related to the coffee shop concept.


Tech Used:

This project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** only, without any external frameworks.


Goal:

The main goal was to practice creating a basic static website, organizing pages, and connecting them together.

This project is simple and not fully professional, but it represents an important training step for learning **web design fundamentals** and writing clean, organized code.
